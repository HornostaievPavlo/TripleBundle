# TripleBundle (spring 2022)
Project contains three games to play - each is implementing different mechanics and visual style. 

Main idea of the project was to take existing games and fully recreate them in Unity adding a personal view on existing mechanics. 

Project implements basics of scene setup and programming with C# in Unity. 

There are three games: Arkanoid, Snake and Bowling.
