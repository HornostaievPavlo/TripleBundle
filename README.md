# TripleBundle
Project contains three games to play - each is implementing different mechanics and visual style. The primary idea behind this project was to take existing games and fully recreate them in Unity, adding a personal touch to existing mechanics. 

There are three games: Arkanoid, Snake and Bowling.

## Arkanoid

- Arkanoid game takes the classic brick-breaking concept and gives it a modern twist by bringing it into the world of 3D. The goal is simple: destroy all the boxes on each level without letting the ball fall below the screen's lower border. If the ball falls, you'll see a brief UI message before the level restarts.
- With three visually distinct levels, each offering a different level of difficulty, there are a variety of challenges to conquer while sticking to the same familiar game mechanics.

## Snake
- Snake game brings a beloved classic into the world of 3D. This endless adventure challenges you to control a moving snake. Your role is to rotate the snake to direct it toward spawning food. Each food item is animated, changing its size as it waits to be devoured. When the snake consumes the food, it grows longer and moves slightly faster. Be cautious: running into yourself ends the game, just as in good old times.

## Bowling
- Bowling game is a physics-based demo that brings the excitement of the bowling alley to your screen. In this scene, you'll perform a throw and witness the results of your hit. After your score is displayed, the level restarts for another round.

- Launching the ball is the heart of the game. As the game begins, the ball starts moving from left to right. On-screen instructions guide you on how to launch the ball. To set the ball's position while it moves side-to-side, press and hold the Space button. While holding Space, a force selector appears. Adjust the force by positioning the black point inside the selector. Release Space, and the ball is thrown with the chosen force.

- Watch the ball's roll closely. The camera follows the ball until it hits the pins.
